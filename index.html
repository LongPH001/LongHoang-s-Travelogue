          <h3>The Parisian Macao</h3>
            <p>
                This picture is taken during my trip to Macau, a destination renowned for its casinos. 
                The Parisian Macao is a luxurious destination that captures the essence of Paris in the heart of Macau. 
                Renowned as one of Macau's most iconic landmarks, the tower blends European brick-building architecture 
                with a touch of modern luxury, featuring golden accents. Its half-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower is inspired by 
                Macau's history and its early Portuguese settlement, making it a symbol of elegance and grandeur in the region. 
                The Parisian Macao offers a unique experience where classic European design meets contemporary opulence.

          <h3>Taipa Village Macau</h3>
            <p>
              Famous Egg Tart Shop, among the many food stops in Taipa Village, Lord Stow's Bakery is an iconic destination for egg tart lovers. Established in 1989, this bakery is credited with popularizing the Portuguese egg tart in Macau.
              Visitors walk by to Lord Stow's Bakery to savor this sweet treat while exploring the iconic streets of Taipa Village. Whether paired with a cup of coffee or enjoyed on its own, the experience of eating a warm, freshly baked egg tart in this picturesque setting is one of Macau's culinary highlights.

      <h3>Hong Kong to Macao bridge</h3>
      <p>
        As you can see from the video recorded by me, the bridge dive straight into the ocean water. It leds to an underground water tunnel.
        The bridge opened in 2018, connect 3 continents altogether (HK to Macau to Zhuhai) becoming the world's longest sea-crossing bridge spanning for over 55 kilometers.
        The view is absolutely stunning, considering you're in the middle of the sea and there is only one road to travel. It gives me the feelings of a fever dream.
